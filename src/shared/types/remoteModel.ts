/**
 * Remote provider model catalog v1 (Phase 5 row 819): host-executed, masked and closed-code.
 *
 * The catalog is the live remote pi runtime's own get_available_models answer, so it uses the host's
 * credentials and network exactly like the host's model picker would. Main masks it to this allowlist before
 * it leaves the process: no apiKey/baseUrl/raw runtime payload and no agentId is ever part of the DTO.
 *
 * The per-provider synthetic HTTP connection probe is NOT part of v1 (its request templates can carry
 * arbitrary URLs/headers); the live-runtime catalog is the only "connection test" remote targets get.
